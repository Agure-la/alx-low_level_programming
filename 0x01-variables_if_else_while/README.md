This directory contains c files about if_else and while control structures of C programming.
In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. Additionally, I practiced declaring and defining variables of type char, int, and unsigned int, using if and if...else statements, and implementing while loops.

  How to declare variables of different types
  How to use arithmetic operators
  How to use if, if ......else statements
  How to use while loop
  How to print varibles of different types using printf
  How to asign values to varibles
 

  to run this files on terminal
  1.cd to this directory
